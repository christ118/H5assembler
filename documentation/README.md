## how to use h5 commands


if you type ``h5a {{your file path}} ``
h5a will build your file and the output will be at **output.html**

you can also specify one or  many build paths in h5A
if you type  ``h5a {{your file path}} {{build_path1}} {{build_path2}} {{build_path4}} ..... .... {{build_pathX}}  ``
h5a the build files will be at all specified build paths


## about the h5maker language 

**H5MAKER language is the most owerful functionnality of H5**
by default when you use h5A you can just build one file but with h5maker its possible to build many files  and deploy your  project for every one



## bugs 

**H5 assembler is a new software so it has  some bugs:**

1. stranger strings writed at the end of output file when you build many file by using h5maker language
2. you must specify the output to a folder that exists
